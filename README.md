## Installation

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.

2. Make a copy of `src/firebase-config-sample.ts` and rename it to `firebase-config.ts`, ensuring that it is placed in the `src` directory.

3. Paste the firebase configuration details into `firebase-config.ts`

4. `ionic-serve` threw a SASS error while building, so I had to run `npm rebuild node-sass` first

5. `ionic cordova run browser` to ensure all plugins are correctly installed

6. `ionic serve --lab` to test the application in Ionic Lab
